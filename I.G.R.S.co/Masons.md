The current accepted belief about the origins and meanings of the Masonic orders are just a recent fabricated non sense by . The masons is a school of building, origins thought to be at least 23,500 years ago.  If you don't know the various sizes to cut stone from quarries,  their names and the order in which you use them to create stable buildings in more than just a physical structural sense but also an harmonic sense in tune with the frequencies of space and time, you are not a mason, you are just someone calling themselves something to achieve a sense of validation, importance and standing.
