Geo-Rheology is the study of the patterns of cause and effect within the Earth's EMF.

Research conducted by Dr.A.M.Davie, of the Newtonian family line, (deceased 2007} from the early 1970's, in collaboration with a Dr.Okubo (assist to Einstein) in the 1980's (lost contact with circa 2000) and myself from 16Nov1991, (currently continuing the research attempting to take it to PhD level), suggests that the Scientists from at least 21,500BCE understood cause and effect within the Earth's EMF and the wider universe to an accuracy of 1000ths of a second in time and distance (space and time)

**Spontaneous Combustion**

Down through the hoary mists of time, myths, legends, folklore and old wives' tales there runs a golden thread of truth. Religious mumbo-jumbo, cult and voodoo practices from all ages, cultures and continents, contain glimmers of knowledge known in the past of why - for no apparent reason - men die.

Some of these stories tell of a person bursting into flames, consumed in a ball of fire. Other stories relate how great men of knowledge pass on to higher spheres at an early age, their bodies racked with a terrible illness. The bones of some poor person wrapped in bandages found in the Egyptian tombs show signs of arthritis. Death and illness played just as important a part of history as it concerns everyone who considers their own destiny. We die a quick death, at some period in time. Few people have tried to find out why.

Research into cases of human spontaneous combustion has provided some remarkable results to show that the cause of death is not what it seems. These horrific deaths of many men and women recorded since 'written' history began, show that on occasion even their clothes are not singed. Yet, all that is left of what was once a living, loving human body is a small heap of carbon. What triggered off research into these frightening deaths was that one case in 1970 occurred at a predetermined time and location, set out numerically from other forms of geophysical phenomena. The death had been forecasted.

In the following months a series of similar deaths were also found to have occurred at specific locations, at preset times of potential hazard. Setting out the firegrounds [locations] on OS (Ordnance Survey) maps, it became obvious that a geometric pattern was being followed. The distance between each site obeyed a Time=Distance syndrome , where several of these distances were identical and precise to a few inches error over several miles distance.

A similar study of human spontaneous combustion using case histories in North America illustrated that a death in the east coast could predetermine a death under these strange circumstances in San Francisco, Hollywood or Canada. The distance between these firegrounds appeared to obey the same Time=Distance syndrome as elsewhere. Calculations to determine the common factor found these distances were multiples of _3.089764481 Feet Scotch._

The atomic weight of isotopes is approximately **3.09** AW. The common factor in all these deaths had been established.

Efforts to find the statistically significant number of all spontaneous combustion fires, ranging from haystack fires to multi-million dollar holocausts found that 93% of these fires could be forecasteded. In the case of haystacks, where a fire had occurred at the predetermined time, an animal was also found to have died at the same moment. The number of these reports indicated that the phenomena were not random or isolated cases, as they occurred too often. These fires and deaths followed a geophysical pattern.

Fires in factories and houses were examined in detail. An accidental fire seldom reaches a full-scale alarm, whereas when a fire occurs at a predetermined location [ie, a natural occurrence], the spread of flames is generally within the first few seconds.

The time of call-out [alarm] is often precise, or within a few minutes of the forecasted time of hazard, in some cases submitted to the senior Fire Officer at brigade headquarters. Setting out these fires on OS maps, the progression of geophysical phenomena allowed ample time to identify other areas suspected of becoming unstable.

One of the odd features recognised in these major fires was the colour of friable material. It appeared that this colour obeyed a spectra based on Time, and progression of the geophysical phenomena.

Collation of data on these colours eventually was to prove invaluable in the understanding of many other facets of the Catastrophe Theory. All the sites investigated where these fires had occurred had been forecasted as potentially dangerous.

Soon this colour phenomena allowed a more precise timing of the event to be identified. A second survey was requested by the authorities in Scotland. Setting out a series of map references, within hours of the lists being submitted, fires were reported at the times of hazard lodged with these officials. However, one fire was not reported for the last location on the list.

A site survey found that instead of a fire, the house owner had died of cardiac infarction.The time of death was precise to the submitted time of danger for that site.

Further surveys showed that other predetermined areas were the addresses of persons whose names had appeared in the obituary columns of the daily newspapers. A full survey was undertaken to establish the statistically significant number of natural deaths capable of being forecasted. The first of these six-monthly surveys indicated that 98-100% of all natural deaths were capable of being forecasted.

Five subsequent surveys failed to alter these percentages. Since these initial surveys no statistical change has been noted: deaths from cancer, cardiac infarction and other well-known causes have confirmed the earlier figures.

The problems of forecasting were investigated to see if prevention of the causative energy could be identified. The more knowledge gained from this field of research, the more it was realised that the subject was not a simple matter, but a highly complex system of Time = Distance = Elements and Colour and Tonal Harmonies.

**Criminology**

For instance, in criminology it was found that in a survey of all capital crime since 1950, in the death of a person by the actions of a deranged person, the suspect obeyed a numerically positive scale of physical features. This scale allowed the description of persons liable to commit a crime, from capital crime to petty theft, to be collated for periods six months **before** a crime was carried out. Using the calculations it was also possible to determine the habitat of the criminal.

While many experts in the field of criminology may hold various opinions of their own, the statistics built up over the last ten years indicate that_the criminal is not necessarily responsible for his actions._

Site conditions can, and no doubt do, play an important role in causing schizophrenic behaviour in many cases, but the underlying energy force can be analysed to show the problem is basically an allergic reaction.

2,500 years ago Plato illustrated in his narratives that the criminal is not responsible for his actions. It is the parents. A child conceived when a parent is under the influence of alcohol, drugs or disease is born with defects in its blood system. The child is subjected to cyclic behavioural patterns at predeterminable periods throughout its life.

The life history of many well-known criminals, some who have committed murder on several occasions, all show the cyclic behavioural patterns associated with the date and time of birth and conception.

**The present trend of irresponsible parents who procreate while under the influence of drugs will result in a generation of men and women who will constantly break the common laws of rational behaviour unless remedial action can be taken to remove the allergic symptoms.**

Research into DNA and genetic engineering

Too often researchers examine only one part of the whole picture. The triple aspects of heredity, environment and diet must now be assessed against a geological background, on a Time=Distance basis. Only then can the analysis be seen in the context of the Catastrophe Theory.

Cancer research over many years has been the sole domain of the medical specialists, backed by the pharmaceutical industry, who have channelled many millions of pounds, marks and dollars into the coffers of their establishments, without any equal sign of success in their efforts to combat the degeneration of their patients' health. Any amateur dowser could have told them where to begin their research. _[If they were seriously into research]_

The more professional dowser knows that the problem of identifying illnesses with substrata aquifers is not as simple as it may appear.

A civil engineer or a geologist can explain that aquifers are not stable waterways below the earth. The path can vary according to the type of materials through which the water flows. Water is not just a stable combination of hydrogen and oxygen, as many people believe.

Few scientific establishments have researched the behaviour of H2O. What may seem to be a harmless liquid can suddenly become a highly destructive and lethal substance, and subsequently revert to the harmless liquid with equally amazing speed.

n 1936, when it was discovered that fog could destroy concrete and roadstone, few scientists would believe it possible. Anomalous water, as it was later named, was shown to be part of the causative energy in machine failures in many types of factories.

In 1973 it became obvious that anomalous water was associated with spontaneous combustion. Professor Symons and his colleagues discovered that anomalous water could be recognised as ionised H20, and developed into many forms of unstable atomic structures.

Today it is recognised that, in the unstable state, radio frequencies are emitted by these droplets of water suspended in the atmosphere, or in substrata liquids. At specific times these radio frequencies alter, and the harmonics in the gamma, ultra-violet and infrared wavebands affect materials within the same harmonics.

When this natural phenomena occurs serious, and often fatal, conditions exist.

The change from stable to highly unstable elements obeys the Time=Distance=Element syndrome, which can be set into the forecasting program. For any amateur dowser, or even a professional surveyor, to attempt to interfere with this natural process, is highly irresponsible and potentially dangerous, unless he can calculate the progression of geophysical phenomena within the **Catastrophe Theory.**

The difficulties faced by anyone who wishes to investigate or prevent the death of a friend who has been diagnosed as having cancer, or other illness, and who has identified an aquifer below the patient's bed or house, soon become apparent. _Elimination of the energy generated by the aquifer does not necessarily remove all the energies._

The energy removed may be the one beneficial forcefield, while the remaining more powerful causative wavebands continue to degenerate the living tissues of the patient.

While no positive reports are available, it is possible that an amateur could remove energies which would allow another equally serious incident to occur. More so, now that seismicity is being considered within the scope of health degeneration within the Catastrophe Theory.

Dr Marsha Adams, Stanford Research International, of Menlo Park in California, found excessive bleeding in post-natal operations. These seemingly unusual cyclic occurrences suggested that other factors were involved, and the bleeding was not through medical neglect.

Looking at other forms of cyclic occurrences, Dr Adams began to look into the background stories of a host of reports on these cyclic events. The collation of data also pointed out that the times of these incidents were closely associated with the occurrences of earthquakes .

The information passed to the Scottish research team allowed the historic data from the archives to be examined in depth. It was realised that seismicity was also obeying the Time=Distance=Element syndrome. Soon every earthquake worldwide within specific range of 4.5 Richter _[this is on the old Richter scale]_ could be forecasted within precise limits.

The methods used to define an earthquake were applied to many incidents worldwide. The Missing Children scandal in Canada (ca 1987) obeyed the strict criteria of the calculations, and unfortunately found that most cases could be considered to have been homicide or murder.

Processing the data for the calculations on seismicity, the updated program showed that the recent earthquakes in China and Mexico City had been forecasted as early as 1980 and 1979. Both the time and distance in all these forecasted quakes were found to be correct to the forecasted program by fractions in both time and space.

When it became obvious that the chemicals, or colour, played an important role in all the cases examined within the Catastrophe Theory, the elements were considered capable of being analysed to produce a forecasting program. We examined the theories of Walter Russell.

**Tracking the causative energy**

_Walter Russell_ had suggested some years before his death that in the Atomic Periodic Tables there were several weights which could contain as yet undiscovered elements.

Science has since confirmed Russell's theory. However, it appeared that he made several minor mistakes. Rectifying these mistakes indicated that the atomic periodic time scale was not only incomplete but that it obeyed a Distance computation.

An earlier search of historic information had discovered that in antiquity various civilisations had worked on atomic theory. Applying both the ancient names and the modern elements to this new scale, it became clear that many old names could not be set against any modern counterpart. Many of the ancient names represented organic elements. The name of Poll was found to be of the same wavelength of pollen taken from several flowers.

Checking out case histories of known geophysical phenomena, the date and time of incident could be analysed against the chemical known to have caused the spontaneous combustion, or other incident. What had been previously unrecognised facets of the natural process and progression could now be traced back to the initial causative energy by the use of the numerical formula.

Illnesses such as cancer, cardiac infarction, multiple-sclerosis, arthritis and schizophrenia then became a series of numbers, which could be identified as natural cyclic processes and located on large or small scale OS maps.

**Dangerous interference**

Efforts to prevent machine failures, and later major fires, allowed the recognition of the difficulties faced in the removal of the causative energies of these geophysical phenomena.

One slight mistake could result in the death of the person whom the survey was attempting to protect. While the habitat of the patient could well be protected, the amateur surveyor would not be aware of the problems created elsewhere.

The strange story of the occurrence in Buenos Aires on March 21, 1936, when an entire house exploded, killing the owner, was, according to the witness, caused by the interference of electromagnetic energy. A house in Glasgow, Scotland, which blew apart, fortunately did not kill anyone.

An explosion which ripped a massive silo in two was caused by a faulty earth wire, at a time when there was no lightning storm. A French priest was killed attempting to degauss natural energy.

In the U.S.A. a resonance pyramid caused so much interference with radio broadcasts that police had to blow the place apart.

A laboratory near Edinburgh was radioactive for six weeks after a student's experiment with a mere spoonful of salt solution.

A recently built, specially designed aluminium structure has had to be 'earthed', or serious damage could have resulted, and could have effected the owner's health.  

**CASE HISTORIES**

_[Note:- recent developments have reduced the timeframes referred to in this section to the SAME DAY ....]_

The daughter of a medical specialist had never been in good health since the day she was born. The date and time of conception allowed calculations to determine that seismic activity was responsible for the health problems.

A homoeopathic doctor was asked to prescribe one dose of the correct chemical, at the prescribed time. The girl is now reported to be 100% fit.

A girl who had had two serious depressive illnesses was examined by the study of her personal history. The illness was recognised as having been seismically induced.

The change from a listless, ill-looking person to a light-hearted tennis-loving healthy person in a matter of ten minutes astounded the mother and medical specialist who witnessed the complete change in this 11 year old girl.

**Calcium deaths**

A medical specialist from the World Health Organisation requested an investigation to resolve the deaths across the world from prescribed calcium tablets. The pharmaceutical researchers apparently have tried to isolate the cause of these deaths over the 100 year period that the problem has been known.

It took just two minutes to recognise that the change from stable to highly unstable conditions of the calcium was the result of seismicity

A patient diagnosed as having terminal cancer is now, according to her own medical specialist, free from the illness. There is a scar on her lungs which requires to be examined regularly, but the patient reports that she is feeling as fit as a person half her age. Treatment lasted 18 days.

A sufferer from Multiple Sclerosis reported he was acting like a zombie. Tests showed that the prescribed dosage of drugs which he had been taking was twice the permitted maximum amount. The patient could not cross the road without assistance. Nine days treatment, without drugs of any kind, and he reported feeling much better. Six months later he was dancing with his wife at a party, something he had never been capable of doing previously.

The cause of illness was traced to two seismic events during the foetal period of his life.

A second patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis was found to have been born at the precise moment of a minor earthquake in the area where her parents lived. Had it not been that other incidents were on file for this area, at the precise moment of this particular birth, the connections between seismicity and MS would not have been so positively established.

Patients with allergies of various kinds have been investigated. Cases in the U.S.A. where patients reported some kind of illness which their own GP had failed to diagnose have been found to conform to the seismicity in that country. A period ranging from a few days to nine days treatment appears to be all that is necessary to remove the cause.

One patient who appeared to have a multitude of symptoms was found to be allergic to the diesel oil from her car, which she drove six years previously

A woman diagnosed as having cancer apparently died three days after being examined. This woman would not go to her own GP, and her life could probably have been saved.

The cause of the illness was traced to the water supply, where the excessive calcium content not only affected her body through allergies, but could be traced to the heavy reaction in all aluminium based utensils in her kitchen.

**Physical Descriptions calculated**

A very beautiful woman was found by her own family doctor to have cancer. Treatment in the infirmary appeared to only reduce the progression of the disease by a few weeks. An examination of her case by numerical data processing indicated that the cause of the illness was a reaction between the substrata chemicals inherent in the rocks and nitro-phosphorus fertilisers in the food which she enjoyed.

Excessive allergies to wheat products could well have been diagnosed at a much earlier stage in the progression of the carcinoma.

Two incorrect dates were given by parents of a 7-year old boy who had treatment in a hospital for rheumatoid arthritis. Calculations enabled the mistakes to be rectified and allowed the home of the family to be identified on an OS map covering 6,000 square miles.

The date, time and location of a triple fatal car accident illustrated that the driver had had a heart attack while driving at 70 mph, and as the car swerved across the carriageway, collided with an oncoming car.

Calculations allowed the description of the deceased to be given to the witness, who confirmed the physical features.

From their abnormal behaviour the calculated descriptions of two youths wanted by the police were found to be the descriptions of the men who caused the death of 66 spectators crushed at a football game.

From the date and time of the fires set, a pyromaniac was identified through calculations to determine the physical description of the suspect.

The young mother who cut off the genitals of her son with a razor was found to be living in a house marked as potentially dangerous.

The suicide of a respectable businessman could possibly have been avoided: his house was used as a marker in the computer program for forecasteding areas of hazard. The calculated description of the individual was found to be correct when the body was identified.

After a series of incidents, the house of a healthy woman appeared on the OS maps as potentially dangerous. Information was given to this woman's doctor regarding the possibility of the development of carcinoma. In due course the woman appeared in his surgery, eventually to die a year later.

This case was one of the first to be predetermined, and no blame can be attached to anyone for this death. The conditions of progression were not understood at this time.

Some years ago the famous athlete Lilian Board was reported as suffering from terminal cancer. From a published picture of Miss Board, the description allowed calculations to be carried out to determine the date and time of death.

This unfortunately was confirmed by the 'untimely' death of this brave woman. In the future the knowledge gained in this case could well be used to prevent many thousands of similar illnesses.
