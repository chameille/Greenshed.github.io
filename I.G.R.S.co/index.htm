<p align="center"><font size="4">Geo-Rheology: </font>This is the
study of the flux of the electro-magnetic energies in the earth,
from Geo-Earth and Rheo-Flow. Some 21,000 years ago a model of
heaven on earth was begun. A triangulation system of standing
stones, hills, earthworks and roads that allowed the people of
the time to understand more fully the patterns and ultimately the
causes of natural geophysical phenomena. From unexplained lights
in the sky, earthquakes, and apparitions to births, deaths and
dis-ease, all nature conforms to a pattern that, using the
correct divisions of time and space, can be understood, even to
the point of being able to prevent any unstable event within
nature from occurring. Using simple and none invasive methods the
levels of electro-magnetic energy that are causing the
instability, be it in the rocks beneath a house or the cells of a
lifeform, can be identified and their polarity corrected. It is
as simple as magnetizing a needle provided the event or dis-ease
is caught in time. &nbsp; </p>
