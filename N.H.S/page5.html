DOWSING SERVICES</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dowsing
is the art of recognizing the truth through the body's cellular
intelligence. Only 1% of people have no ability in this area. As
well as taking on tasks involving dowsing myself, I try to
encourage people to learn and experiment for themselves in trying
to find out all the things that give them a positive or negative
response. The pendulum, hazel twig or whatever instrument you
associate with Dowsing is an amplifier of your own muscular
responses to what is right or wrong, or where something or
someone lost happens to be. If you are interested I can help you
learn or try and get results myself as to where something might
be or what might be the problem healthwise and what may solve
that problem.</font> &nbsp; </p>
