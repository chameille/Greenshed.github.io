<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is
a possibility that things manifesting themselves physically,
emotionally or intellectually acts as an indicator of something
amiss in the direction that any one or all of these facets of
ourselves are taking. Perhaps accidents are not really accidents
but pointers towards areas in our lives that need more care or
attention:- Repeatedly damaging your hands for example could mean
something you are involved in doing, creating, manipulating
(usually looked at negatively??) is perhaps not quite right for
you or causing pain, needs to be handled with more attention, who
knows, the possibilities are endless and all of them deserve to
be considered for each individual.</font> &nbsp; </p>
