<p align="center">Please copy and distribute this leaflet to all
particularly M.P.s and others who may be able to influence the
decision making in our Government at present. Thankyou for your
attention and I hope the importance of the possibilities of being
able to predict events within nature using the correct divisions
of time and space from car-crashes, burglaries, unexplained house
fires, murders and where people think they see U.F.O.s to
earthquakes, volcanoes, dis-ease in all life, and that other
beautiful phenomena crop-circles. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">HAVE A GOOD LAUGH OR CRY! YOU WILL NEED IT. It
is not often we can enjoy a laugh which has our sides aching or
the tears rolling down our cheeks. This story, however, may bring
you tears of frustration, or even sorrow. The problem is that the
causes of misery will intensify in the future as we move further
and further from the natural divisions of time and distance, this
may sound ludicrous equating measures of time and distance with
misery but I urge you to keep an open mind and read on. Have you
ever looked at any article you buy and said to yourself,
&#147;What the deuce is a Gram.?&#148; It is a criminal offence
to ask for a Pound or an Ounce of anything you wish to purchase.
If you do want a fly nip of whisky it will be in so many fluid
&#147;cc&#148;, whatever this may mean to the befuddled personal
computer you carry around beneath your hat. Even that precious
bundle of grey matter is subject to being measured, not in effort
to concentrate but in some wierd unit of measure that you have
probrably never heard of before. Your car will not hold a Gallon
of petrol any longer. On your way to work in the morning after
filling up at the local garage with petrol delivered from the
pump in Litres, you may wonder just how much you will have to pay
in &#147;Ecu&#148;, once we have a common currency with our
European neighbours. You may be wondering what the H... an
&#147;Ecu&#148; is worth in Pounds, Shillings and Pence. Your
concentration may be shattered by some doting Father&#146;s pride
and joy buzzing your car to get out of his way in his foreign
made sports buggy enabling him to pass you, seemingly at the
Speed of Light, 300,000 Kilometres per second. Three hundred
thousand Kilometres, your brain box tells you this is a strange
measure, for at school you were taught the velocity of Light was
183,470 English Miles per second. A Frenchman by the name of Leon
Foucault experimented with turning mirrors to suggest 185,170
English Miles per second. Then there was Newton,&nbsp; surveying
the ancient monuments on his ancestor&#146;s estate at Newton
House, Newton, Midlothian,&nbsp; in Scotland he found, in the
geometry, a measure of 165,131.5604 Mhiles Scotch per second, and
a Light Year of 5,211,241,479,000 Mhiles Scotch. 300,000
Kilometres when converted becomes 186,264.5149 Royal Miles, or
165,362.673 Mhiles Scotch. It becomes obvious something is wrong.
The difference between the two figures of 165,362.673 Mhiles
Scotch (equal to 300,000Km) and 165,131.5604 of Newton&#146;s
calculation is 231.1126 Mhiles Scotch. Converting Mhiles to Feet
Scotch indicates a distance of 1,375,613.18 Feet or Cass Scotch.
A measurement of over a MILLION feet in error per second, that is
43,411,764,810,000 Cass per Light Year??? This figure is
incomprehensible, but better understood as representing an error
of 8,221,925,153 Imperial Miles in the estimates of the Speed of
Light per Year. In 1926 Albert Einstein attempted to define the
formula of the Quantum Field Theory, and from this there evolved
the hypothesis regarding the &#147;Big Bang&#148; theory. The
next question is &#147;Did Einstein knickers in a twist?&#148;
Clara Speight-Humberston, who in 1922 wrote &#147;The Hidden
Secret of Einstein&#146;s Theory of Relativity&#148; illustrates
an important factor in young Albert&#146;s education. The author
demolishes every hypothesis ever made by Einstein as containing
schoolboy errors, and claims the Swiss Jew never, in his whole
life, carried out one single mathematical calculation according
to Nature. This indictment, if true has a vast bearing on the way
modern Physicists and Chemists work. Let us examine the truth of
Einstein&#146;s life&#146;s work. No-one can deny Einstein did
some marvellous work in creating a number of formulae. His most
famous being E=mc2. Energy = Mass x The Speed of Light Squared.
We have allready seen that there is something drastically wrong
with the speed of Light when measured in the French Metric
System. Sir Isaac Hamilton, of Newton and Woolsthorpe set out in
later works and in &#147;Principia&#148; his Laws of Nature and
Gravitational Energies. Aristotle in his Scientific Criteria
stated &#147;Time and Distance are divided by the same and equal
divisions&#148;.&nbsp; Two views of Nature that, when set against
the mathematics of Einstein illustrate the errors. Brought up in
a close&nbsp; Jewish religious background, the youthful Albert
Einstein was taught to read the Kabballah, with letters
representing both their alphabetical and numerical values. There
is nothing wrong with such learning, but to quantify formula from
words can be fraught with hazards. The modern Kabballah is not
the ancient Caibh Allaidh that Newton used in his later days. If
Einstein made mistakes in his calculations to define the
Catastrophe Theory, we must also look at the theories of others
on which he relied so much. Einstein must have realised
Mendeleyev&#146;s Atomic Periodic Tables were faulty or he would
never have spent so much time trying to evolve his own system of
Atomic Weights. This system also has not one single Element in
its rightful position in the Atomic Harmonic Scale. This Atomic
Scale designed by Einstein cannot fulfil Newton&#146;s Scientific
Criteria,&nbsp; &#147;All nature is predictable therefore any
scientific hypothesis must be capable of forecasting to be
considered valid.&#148; This scale becomes untenable in any
branch of science, except within its own corrupt system. The
present Atomic Periodic Table, designed by Mendeleyev in his
dream, also does not conform to this statement made by Newton to
his critics. The Laws of other European philosophers such as
Ampere, Gauss, Hertz, Ohms, Volta and others who used the French
Metric System of measure,&nbsp; must also require to be examined
to see whether their Laws can predetermine any Natural
Geophysical phenomena. So far, there are no indications that any
of these European Theories can predetermine Earthquakes,
Spontaneous Combustion, dis-ease, accidents or any other Natural
events. Who then can we blame for these errors which have been
adopted by modern academia? There are many clues to identify the
culprits. Sir John Herschel, in various Court Cases, gave
evidence as to why the French Metric Measures should not be
adopted by European Governments. In these extant papers, Herschel
set out the sorry story of how the Metric System came to be
invented. King Louis XVI of France was beset by traders to sort
out the muddle of Weights and Measures across France after the
amalgamation of the various departments under the one system. The
King called on the professional surveyors to set out scales which
would be simple and able to be understood by all citizens of
France. After deliberation, the architects, surveyors, officials
and all concerned proclaimed there could not be a concensus to
satisfy everyone. The King requested assistance from other was
little hope of ever finding a common system to cover all
countries. In desperation the King ordered two of his courtiers
to find a system that could be could be imposed on everyone. At
this time there were two gentlemen at his court whom everyone
considered to be &#147;obnoxious&#148;. It is left to the reader
to interpret&nbsp; what was meant by this description. Counts
Delambre and Mechain considered that a measure between the 51st
and 41st degree Parallel would allow the Polar Circumference to
be inarguably a unit of measure on which to base not only weights
and measures, but fluids, coins and everything else. Gathering
all the equipment for the task of measuring from Dunkirk to Gava,
south of Barcelona on the 358th degree Longitude, known also as
the old French 0 degree Longitude, they included FIVE CARTLOADS
of Champagne in their baggage. If we consider the task these two
amateur surveyors were attempting, the first thing is that Nature
does not conform to the Polar Circumference except in the matter
of the Earth&#146;s Magnetic Field and some less important
features. Secondly the route to measure the shortest distance
from &#147;A&#148; to &#147;B&#148; must be a straight line
between the two points. If we examine a map of France, there is a
range of mountains known as the Pyrenees. At Pic Carlit the
summit height of this range is 9,372.593188 feet,&nbsp; probrably
slightly less where the Longitudinal line passes over the
mountain. Can you imagine two drunken surveyors climbing nine
thousand feet with their Troise measuring sticks and chains, to
ensure there were not even an inch in error? Can you also imagine
someone swimming the distance from the coast to the point where
the 358th degree Longitude crosses the 41st degree Latitude. We
can envisage the Counts contemplating what to do while standing
on the shore at Gava Point, bedecked in their finery, wigs and
powdered faces, confronted with measuring some nineteen miles to
the cross reference point. Needless to say, to compound the
inaccuracies, they ignored having to define the distance from the
shore to the 41st Parallel. This emission of about 30 Kilometres
from their calculations adds to the meaninglessness of the final
result of the Standard Measure which became law in France. A Law
that the British Government and the Metrification Board has
imposed on the industry and citizens of England and Wales. To add
insult to the Romans, the Greeks and other ancient civilisations,
Counts Delambre and Mechain plagiarised the names of old measures
that have withstood the ravages of time for thousands of years.
The &#147;Are&#148; is taken from the name of a note in music of
the 1st, 4th and 7th hexachords. The French Measure being equal
to 119.6 square yards, or 1076.4 square feet Scotch, a measure
which does not repeat as an harmonic of any natural Geophysical
phenomena known now or into the distant past. The Litre, a unit
of capacity, was taken from the Greek word for a Pound in weight.
A Stere is supposed to represent 35.3 Cubit Feet. The funny part
of this name is that a harmony of the mass almost matches a
formula used by Amoses (Moses) and can be seen in the Rhind
Mathematical Papyrus. The margin of error however precludes the
measure from being used in any apparent Natural calculation known
at present. A Gramme, or 15.432 ounces Troy cannot afford to
represent a number of various grain seeds, except possibly
peppercorn, or some other exceptionally small seeds. The system
therefore fails completely to provide a range of weights and
measures, for which the exercise was intended, to remove the
confusion within traders in France in 1790. The system is
therefore a complete waste of time and money, not only two
hundred years ago but also now. Have you cried yet? Well here is
something to cheer about. The day following the legalisation of
the Metric System in France, King Louis XVI considered it
advisable to have an extended holiday, somewhere far from Paris,
possibly a desert island in the Pacific. Unfortunately he
fell&nbsp; into the hands of a few of his subjects, who
apparently did not like the idea of their King fleeing for his
life. Two other &#147;obnoxious&#148; persons from his court were
also apprehended and some days later had serious surgical
operations carried out on their throats by none other than that
famous surgeon Madame Guillotine. We might even suggest a number
of others who should have had a similar operation. It is now time
to laugh and he who laughs last, laughs longest, as the old adage
says. From the time of Genesis, some 15,000 BC., the unit of
measure was based on the international foot, from Japan westwards
to the Phillipines. The Fot, Foot, Cass, Cois, Kos, Cho, Chu,
Schuhe, Schue, Shoe, Cu, Co, Zu, Triod, Trodh and Trod of ten
inches all made their marks in the sands of Time. In that ancient
country of the Ghears, Gaels, Celts and Scots, this simple and
Natural measure was established in Law. Any person who is stupid
enough to argue with a 15,000 year old legacy can measure, as Sir
Isaac Hamilton of Newton did around the year 1680, the&nbsp;
various units of natural measure on ancient monuments. King David
I, of Scotland, circa 1141 AD. Confirmed these measures into an
Act of Parliament, and later King James II, again in another act,
made a similar decree, which states; </p>

<p align="center">The Law in Scotland is clear and persons who
trade with another person of the Kings Realm using a measure
other than those named, or divisions or multiples of the same
measures, will be prosecuted, their belongings forfeited, or
imprisoned for as long as the King or Queen recommends. These
Laws cannot be changed for all times to come. It is therefore
unlawful for any person in Scotland to sell, buy, display or
attempt to barter any goods by the use of the French Metric
System. All such Laws made by the Parliament in London are
therefore null and void in Scotland. Any person charged under the
present Law where the French Metric System is in question can
quote these Acts of David I and James II in defence of the
accusation against them. While there is only a slim chance any
person may be imprisoned under these new Laws there is a far more
serious problem to be faced. Academia, from Kindergarden Teachers
to senior University Lecturers for the last hundred years have
been brainwashing innocent students to calculate the easy way, in
units of tens within the Metric System. It seems odd that these
pompous and often bullying teachers have forgotten that as a baby
they spent their entire waking day counting, in their strange
babbling, the number of toes they had on their feet without the
help of Counts Delambre and Mechain. Fortunately, there is a
growing number of real scientists who have realised something is
wrong. No one in seismology, by their own admission, can prevent
earthquakes, or understand how a lockfast building could erupt in
flames from no apparent cause. Silly scholastic asses have
attempted to create Crop Circles in cornfields. They are totally
unaware how natural geophysical phenomena perform these strange
miracles. Who then can we blame? It is a general trend by many to
blame the politicians for all the ills of society. Members of
this illustrious band of dedicated men and women are only as good
as their advisors. As Aristotle stated,&nbsp; &#147;In Utopia,
polititians would be scientists, and scientists
polititians&#148;. If they, who govern us, are not senior
scientists, then they have to rely on those who are considered
experts in their particular field. It is these faceless, and
brainless individuals in a foreign land who are dictating what we
should and should not do. Something is drastically wrong with the
system of government of what should be a brotherhood of nations.
&#147;Laughter is the best cure&#148; is another old saying. The
one thing egotistic, domineering people consider unbecoming is
for someone to laugh at their ridiculous attitudes. What better
way to prick their bubble or demean their position, than to take
the course of laughter by following the example shown in the
nursery story of the King who wore no clothes. The advocates of a
system developed by two drunken amateur surveyors in 1790 should
be exposed to all the ridicule of people who have at the very
least some plain common sense. The followers of the &#147;Gods of
science&#148; from the Victorian era, who concoct algebraic
gobbledegook, that only they can understand, should be told to go
back to their prams and count their toes. The Education System
should know better than to divert from the teachings of the
master of all sciences, Mother Nature. We can do no better than
to follow in the footsteps of the Classical Masters, who were
backed by thousands of years of experience and spoke with one
voice across the world. Their voice may now be silent, but their
words and their knowledge are still available to those who
understand, and have eyes to see, without being blinkered by the
teachings of false prophets. Are you still crying? Were you part
of the army of businessmen who spent a small fortune re-equipping
your factories to the Metric System? Are you part of the majority
of the population who still find themselves having to convert a
measure into Inches and Feet? If you live in Scotland then you
have the free choice to use the old system of weights and
measures lawfully. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
situation is different. These silly Laws imposed by the European
Parliament must be repealed. This will generate a further loss of
profit by firms who altered all their machinery in the first
place, when in the future we have to revert back again in order
to make sense of the Natural Order of things and solve the
problems causing the misery and suffering in the world. As Newton
said &#147;All Nature is predictable&#148;, but only if we use
the correct divisions in &#147;Time and Distance&#148;. Who is to
pay the cost of reinstating a natural and correct system of
weights and measures? The choice is obvious. First we must set
our own house in order. Our representatives in Parliament must be
made aware the majority of people in the country did not wish to
be inconvenienced in the first place. Why should we, who are in
the right be dictated to by those in the wrong? Send the bill
back to those who were the cause of the confusion in the first
place. If the French Government refuse to conform to a sensible,
and international system that has stood the test of time,&nbsp;
let them go on their lonely way. Impose a duty on all goods they
export that will eventually pay for the damage their stupidity
has inflicted on industry, education and science. The Problem is
too serious to allow this corrupt unnatural system to destroy
forever the birthright of all who walk in the footsteps of the
Great Masters. &nbsp; </p>
