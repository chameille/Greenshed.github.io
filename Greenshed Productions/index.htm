<p align="center">Welcome to,&nbsp;<a name="GREENSHED"></a><font
size="6">GREENSHED PRODUCTIONS, </font>a continually changing
thing, so if you're interested in the Infinite Universe, Health
or Asking questions about accepted beliefs and practices, it may
be worth a bookmark to come back at some point. This is an
informal page that will slowly build into an <a
href="#Introduction:">intro</a>., list of <a href="#Contents:">contents</a>
and other interesting <a href="#Places:">places</a> I have been.
All the things stated as fact have been proved to 98.8% accuracy.
We are not interested in misleading speculation and conjecture
unless it is acknowledged as such. Some of the information is in
pages of text, it would be best to read these off line or print
them out while going somewhere else. These pages will be marked
&quot;Text&quot;. Happy hunting it may seem a bit bare at the
moment but I can assure you it will fill out and connect together
more topics than you thought possible, finding the sources of the
myths and mysteries in the history of our evolution. Questioning
the prevailing interpretations of some ancient books. One to grab
attention or lose it depending on the readers associations is the
Bible. Building the model of heaven on earth described in the Old
Testament gives a possible date of 21,500BC, that being when the
stars matched the alignments. Also, at the very beginning in
Genesis, it says some very simple words &quot;God is Light&quot;,
excuse my ignorance but does this need any interpretation or
reading into, it says very clearly that The Creator is LIGHT!!!!
You know that stuff that gets us up in the mornings and connects
every point in the infinite universe. Now there's another one,
the universe and the accepted big bang theory, to me that is like
a May fly watching a human breathing in and deciding, because of
its limited view, that one day the human would explode or just
keep getting bigger and that therefore tracing it back, came from
nothing and just started breathing in. Not as is indicated in
nature everywhere that everything has a rhythm, a pulse, a cycle
whatever you want to call it, an in and an out. If I've lost your
interest, so be it, if not, here we go..... </p>

<p align="center">To be honest I am after the truth behind it
all, the common denominator, how did it all come to pass? is
there a point? does anything matter? is my life long enough to
even bother contemplating it? am I on my own in wanting to find
out? or just another self centered, egotistical nutjob. I
certainly don't want to bring anyone elses ideas down but add to,
develop and find proof, instead of this constant uncertainty and
suggestion of something more than this, of aliens and
conspiracies, mis-interpretations and wishful thinking. No-one
can be sure of their interpretations of what has happened or what
they have seen. We can see pictures of all sorts of things in all
sorts of places from faces in the clouds to patterns in the dots
on wallpaper. I cannot argue that there is life on an infinite
number of planets in an infinite universe but whether it can
uproot itself and create the conditions identical to that of its
home, travel infinite distances to buzz infinite planets or teach
infinite lifeforms things that would be relevent to their
existance, is another story. There is something behind all these
stories, something tangible, not just filling your head with
conspiracies, the wierd and the wonderful but an understanding of
natural geophysical phenomena. An understanding of the universe
(one song) that could go back more than 21,500 years to the
building of the first temple, a model of heaven on earth allowing
the prediction of events within the catastrophe theory. It being
the fuel behind all the myths and legends of god, magic,
soothsaying, visions, miracles, treasures and healing prevailing
in the world, obsessing tyrants from early emperors and pharoes
through to Hitler and others in our modern (from moderation) age.
